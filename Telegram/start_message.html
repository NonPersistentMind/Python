<b>🍀 Greetings, %%username%% 🍀</b>

<i>You've started an ImageEncriptionBot – a bot that makes your life more interesting by adding some cool image encription to it.</i>

This bot is capable of <b><i>inserting any text message you want</i></b> into a picture, basically allowing you to <b><i>hide the information you want</i></b> 🔐🔐🔐 inside of an image until someone you give it to uses this or similar program to extract it.

—————————————————————

To use this bot take the next steps:

<b>1) To insert message into image:</b>

• Pick an image you want just like you always do when sending photos to your friends;
• In the same message, just after you picked an image, write a message you would like to insert. <b>(Make sure to do this in the same message, because the bot assumes that any raw file is for extracting info)</b>;
• Send a message and wait for the bot to send you an encripted image. Save this image;
• Have fun! Or go and handle this image to someone who knows what to do with it. In any case, you are done here.

<b>2) To extract info from an image:</b>

• Make sure the image you are using really has a message in it;
• Pick this image but not like you did when inserting message. It is important to send you image untouched by telegram – hence, use the "send as a file" or "send uncompressed" or whatever option. <b>Just make sure telegram doesn't mess with it</b>;
• Send an image with no text. This tells the bot you want to get some message from it;
• Have your message and have fun.
